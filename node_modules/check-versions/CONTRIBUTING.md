1. Please fork topic branches from `development`.
2. Please run and pass `npm run pre-commit` before committing. That script lints code, checks style, runs tests, and requires 100% coverage.
3. Please send a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/check-versions). If you have strong reasons to prefer a different method, feel free to send an e-mail.
